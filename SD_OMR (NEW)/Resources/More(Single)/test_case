    (OMR_Single_1.png): Pass/Fail
    The program should,
        -Detect Q20
        -Reject Q20 by setting mark as 0

#Test case 2:
    (OMR_Single_2.png): Pass/Fail
    The program should,
        -Detect Q13
        -Reject Q13 by setting mark as 0

#Test case 3:
    (OMR_Single_3.png): Pass/Fail
    The program should,
        -Detect Q15
        -Reject Q15 by setting mark as 0

#Test case 4:
    (OMR_Single_4.png): Pass/Fail
    The program should,
        -Detect Q17
        -Reject Q17 by setting mark as 0

#Test case 5:
    (OMR_Single_5.png): Pass/Fail
